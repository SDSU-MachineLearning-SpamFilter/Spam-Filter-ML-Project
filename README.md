# Spam-Filter-ML-Project
Spam filter machine learning model that accurately classifies emails as spam or not spam. 

## Project Overview
Spam emails waste time, clutter our inboxes, and can lead to scams or identity theft. Our current dilemma is that spam messages are constantly evolving, and they are getting trickier, sneakier, and harder to detect, making rule-based filters less effective. 

This project uses **machine learning** to automatically detect emails as **spam or not spam**, using real examples rather than static rules.  

## Goals
- Build an ML model to detect spam with at least 80% accuracy.
- Use real data (Enron Spam Dataset)

## Technologies
- **Python**
- **skikit-learn**
- **pandas, numpy**


## Dataset 
**source** : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcelwiechmann/enron-spam-data (Enron Data Set) 

## How it works
1. Preprocess text
2. Train models with Random Forest, k-NN, SVM 
3. Evaluate accuracy
